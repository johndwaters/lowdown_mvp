    You are writing for *The Lowdown*, a defense and aviation-focused newsletter. Your task is to analyze the following article and produce two distinct components: a new headline and a fully formatted newsletter summary.

    **Article Title:** {title}
    **Article URL:** {url}
    **Full Content:**
    ---
    {truncated_content}
    ---

    ### üìù Output Format:
    Your final output must be structured *exactly* as follows, with each section on a new line and nothing else.

    **HEADLINE:** [A concise, engaging headline. It should be creative and distinct from the original article title, with a touch of dry, witty humor. This should be plain text without any markdown or emojis.]
    **SUMMARY_BODY:** [A fully formatted, single markdown block. It must start *exactly* with a üéØ emoji, followed by the headline in bold. The body should be a compact paragraph (3-5 sentences) summarizing the article with natural hyperlinks. It must end with `(more)` hyperlinked to the original article URL: {url}]

    ### ‚úÖ Tone and Style Guidelines (for SUMMARY_BODY):
    - **Direct, factual, and context-rich.**
    - Provide **critical operational context** (e.g., delays, strategic impact).
    - Include **specific stats** and program names.
    - For technical topics, link to a **Wikipedia or authoritative reference**.
    - **DO NOT use em-dashes** (‚Äî).

    ### Example SUMMARY_BODY:
    üéØ **A-10s Head to the Boneyard Early**

    The U.S. Air Force is looking to send its entire A-10 Warthog fleet to retirement sooner than planned and is also axing the E-7 Wedgetail program, citing cost and delays. This is part of a major fleet shakeup in the 2026 budget proposal that also shuffles F-16s and F-15s, while boosting funds for the B-21 Raider and Sentinel ICBM. The whole plan depends on a budget bill passing, otherwise the Space Force might have to tighten its belt. ([more]({url}))
